This is the standard "Hello World" program, written in C++ using the Qt library. 

It represents the first in a series of small programs written to demonstrate different aspects of the C++ programming language and the Qt library.

While the program is small and simple, there are already a lot of things going on before you see the final output. Find out more in [the related article "The first program"](https://www.alternative-computer-programming.com/cpp-tutorial-002-the-first-program.html).
