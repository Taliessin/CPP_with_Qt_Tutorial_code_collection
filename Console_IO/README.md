**C++ with Qt Tutorial: Console_IO**

This is a short demonstration program for different console output and input options in C++. It was created as a central code collection for two separate articles of the *C++ with Qt tutorial* on [the alternative-computer-programming.com website](https://www.alternative-computer-programming.com).

This article series is intended to be a basic C++ programming tutorial for beginners. You can find additional information in the related articles on the ACP website which can be accessed from the [index page for the "C++ with Qt" tutorial](https://www.alternative-computer-programming.com/cplusplus-with-qt-tutorial-index.html). 

While the [first article](https://www.alternative-computer-programming.com/cpp-tutorial-003-console-output.html) deals with the output functions, the [second article](https://www.alternative-computer-programming.com/cpp-tutorial-004-console-input.html) is about the input functions. 

Further parts of the tutorial can also be accessed from the [ACP tutorial page for the "C++ with Qt" tutorial](https://www.alternative-computer-programming.com/cplusplus-with-qt-tutorial-index.html).
